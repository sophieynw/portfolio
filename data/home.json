        "about": "I’m a Toronto-based full-stack developer with a strong interest in machine learning and data science, combining my passion for programming with a dedication to social justice and addressing inequality. While I enjoy full-stack work, I especially excel in backend development—-architecting systems, building APIs, and solving logic-heavy problems is where I thrive. I’m disciplined and self-motivated; always eager to understand how things work and solve problems. A proud 'nerd,' I bring curiosity and rigor to every project I take on. My entrepreneurial spirit, driven by a love for continuous learning and system-building, has led me to create multiple successful businesses and find innovative ways to apply my expertise."
